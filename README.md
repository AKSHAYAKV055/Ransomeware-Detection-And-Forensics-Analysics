# Ransomeware-Detection-And-Forensics-Analysics

This project focuses on the detection and forensic analysis of ransomware attacks. Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system or data, typically by encrypting it, until a ransom is paid. The key objectives of this project are:

* Detection : 
    Implementing techniques and tools to identify ransomware activities in real-time. This 
    includes monitoring for unusual file access patterns, changes in file extensions, and other 
    indicators of compromise.

* Forensics Analysis :
    Conducting detailed investigations to understand the attack vector, the extent of the damage, 
    and the methods used by the attackers. This involves analyzing logs, reverse engineering 
    ransomware samples, and identifying the encryption algorithms used.

* Mitigation and Prevention Developing strategies to mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks and 
 prevent future incidents. This includes recommending best practices for data backup, network 
 segmentation, and user training.

By combining robust detection mechanisms with comprehensive forensics analysis, this project aims to enhance the overall security posture against ransomware threats.
